### About GitHub Packages
GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects.

### About packages
A package is a self-contained and reusable piece of software that includes code and metadata, such as current version number, name, and the package's dependencies, that a developer bundles together in a common place for others to use. Packages simplify using and distributing solutions to common problems such as needing a common framework for developing a project, testing runners and linters to improve code quality, or introducing industry-standard machine learning tools to power your application.

### About GitHub Packages
GitHub Packages is a package hosting service, fully integrated with GitHub. GitHub Packages combines your source code and packages in one place to provide integrated permissions management and billing, so you can centralize your software development on GitHub.

You can publish packages in a public repository (public packages) to share with all of GitHub, or in a private repository (private packages) to share with collaborators or an organization. You can use GitHub roles and teams to limit who can install or publish each package, as packages inherit the permissions of the repository. Anyone with read permissions for a repository can install a package as a dependency in a project, and anyone with write permissions can publish a new package version.

You can host multiple packages in one repository and see more information about each package by viewing the package's README, download statistics, version history, and more.

You can integrate GitHub Packages with GitHub APIs, GitHub Actions, and webhooks to create an end-to-end DevOps workflow that includes your code, CI, and deployment solutions.
